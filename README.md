Radio buttons for Objective-C
=========================

U can use the TNRadioButtonGroup class to use some pre-built radio buttons, or you can extend it really easy to suit your own design.
Every radio button has a selected animation.  When the text is longer then the available space, it will automatically wrap the text over multiple lines.

The current version supports 3 different radio buttons:

1. Circle radio button

2. Square radio button

3. Custom image radio button

Installation
=============

## Manual
* Just drag the files in the src folder to your project.
* Import the radio button class you want to use

## Cocoapods
* Add ``` pod 'TNRadioButtonGroup' ``` to your Podfile
* Done

How to use
==========

Import the ```TNRadioButtonGroup.h``` file.

Create data objects for every option in your radio button group.  You can use the following data objects: ```TNCircularRadioButtonData```, ```TNRectangularRadioButtonData```, ```TNImageRadioButtonData```.

Every data object extends ```TNRadioButtonData```, but has specific properties you can set.

You can set the following properties on every data object:

Property  | What does it do
 ------------- | ------------- 
 identifier    | Set a human readeble name for the radio button
 labelText    | Set the text for the label
 selected    | Set the selected state
 labelFont    | Set the font for the label
 labelColor    | Set the color for the label

The different classes have the following extra properties:

### TNCircularRadioButtonData

Arguments  | What does it do
 ------------- | ------------- 
 borderColor    | Set the border color for the outer circle
 circleColor    | Set the color for the inner circle
 borderRadius    | Set the radius for the outer circle
 circleRadius    | Set the color for the inner circle

Example
 
    TNCircularRadioButtonData *maleData = [TNCircularRadioButtonData new];
    maleData.labelText = @"Male";
    maleData.identifier = @"male";
    maleData.selected = YES;
    maleData.borderColor = [UIColor blackColor];
    maleData.circleColor = [UIColor blackColor];
    maleData.borderRadius = 12;
    maleData.circleRadius = 5;
 
### TNRectangularRadioButtonData

Arguments  | What does it do
 ------------- | ------------- 
 borderColor    | Set the border color for the outer rectangle
 rectangleColor    | Set the color for the inner rectangle
 borderWidth    | Set the width for the outer rectangle
 borderHeight    | Set the height for the outer rectangle
 rectangleWidth    | Set the width for the inner rectangle
 rectangleHeight    | Set the height for the inner rectangle
 
Example

    TNRectangularRadioButtonData *snowboardData = [TNRectangularRadioButtonData new];
    snowboardData.labelText = @"Snowboarding";
    snowboardData.identifier = @"snowboarding";
    snowboardData.selected = NO;
    snowboardData.borderColor = [UIColor blackColor];
    snowboardData.rectangleColor = [UIColor blackColor];
    snowboardData.borderWidth = snowboardData.borderHeight = 12;
    snowboardData.rectangleWidth = snowboardData.rectangleHeight = 5;

### TNImageRadioButtonData

Arguments  | What does it do
 ------------- | ------------- 
 selectedImage    | Set the image for the selected state
 unselectedImage    | Set the image for the unselected state
 
Example 

    TNImageRadioButtonData *coldData = [TNImageRadioButtonData new];
    coldData.labelText = @"Hot";
    coldData.identifier = @"hot";
    coldData.selected = YES;
    coldData.unselectedImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"unchecked"];
    coldData.selectedImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"checked"];

When you have created the different data objects, you can create an instance of ```TNRadioButtonGroup``` and pass an array with the data objects and set the layout. The layout can be horizontal or vertical.

You can also set the margin between each item via the ``` marginBetweenItems ``` property. By default it's set to 15 pixels.

If you want, you can also set the ``` identifier``` property to have a human readable name for the group.

Call the ```create``` method and set the ```position``` property to place the group at a specific point.  Don't worry about the frame, this will be automatically calculated.
And add the object to the view hierarchy.

    self.myGroup = [[TNRadioButtonGroup alloc] initWithRadioButtonData:@[data1, data2, data3] style:TNRadioButtonGroupStyleHorizontal];
    self.myGroup.identifier = @"My group";
    [self.myGroup create];
    self.myGroup.position = CGPointMake(15, 50);
    [self addSubview:self.myGroup];

Done!

## Getting change notifications

When the state of the radio button group has changed an _NSNotification_ is broadcasted.

You can listen to the ``` SELECTED_RADIO_BUTTON_CHANGED ``` message.

    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(myGroupGotUpdated:) name:SELECTED_RADIO_BUTTON_CHANGED object:self.myGroup];

## Styling checkboxes
### Group-level
If you want to provide the same label font and color for all radio buttons in a specific group, you can set the ``` labelFont ``` and ```labelColor ``` properties.

### Checkbox-level
If you want to provide different label fonts and/or colors for specific radio buttons in a group, you can set the ``` labelFont ``` and ``` labelColor ``` properties on the TNRadioButton subclass.

Creating custom radio buttons
===========================
If you want it is really easy to add your own custom radio buttons.

1. Create a data model class in which you store the specific data for your checkbox. This class needs to extend ``` TNRadioButtonData ```.

2. Create a radio button class which extends ``` TNRadioButton ```.

3. Override the ``` setup ``` method (don't forget to call the super method at the end).

4. Override the ``` createRadioButton ``` method, here you can draw your custom radio button.

5. Override the ``` checkWithAnimation: ``` method to supply your own animations when the radio button state changes.

6. There is no step 6.


Demo

There is a demo project added to this repository, so you can see how it works.
